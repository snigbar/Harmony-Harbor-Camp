## [Live link: Harmony Harbor Cammp](https://harmony-harbor-6a3b0.web.app/)

Harmony Harbor Camp is a website built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, incorporating JWT (JSON Web Tokens), TanStack Query, and Axios. The website provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and supports three different roles: admin, user, and instructor.

-------

The website utilizes MongoDB as the database to store camp-related data such as classes, users, and instructors. Express is used as the backend framework to handle API requests and implement the necessary CRUD operations. JWT is employed for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to different features based on the user's role.


## Features

- Google login integration for seamless authentication
- Admin panel for managing camp operations and administrative tasks
- Instructor panel for instructors to manage their classes and interact with students
- User panel for users to explore and enroll in classes, and access their dashboard
- Stripe payment integration for secure and convenient online payments
- Private routes that are only accessible to authorized users
- Secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for enhanced security
- Routes protected to ensure only authorized users can access them
